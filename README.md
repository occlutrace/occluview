OccluView is an open-source desktop viewer from Dental Cloud Technologies for
dental scans and common mesh files.

## Features

- Full-window orthographic 3D viewport with orbit, pan, retargeting, cut view,
  ruler, and wall-thickness measurement.
- Multiple layers with visibility, opacity, tint, and wireframe controls.
- Face selection by click, rectangle, or lasso, with surface and through-mesh
  modes.
- Mesh editing: delete, crop, cut, separate, close selected holes, keep the
  largest component, invert normals, repair, smooth, and undo/redo.
- Windows Explorer thumbnails, live Preview Pane, file associations, and
  context-menu integration installed by the MSI.
- Native Linux desktop integration with MIME registration and a thumbnailer.

## Formats

| Format | Support |
| --- | --- |
| `.stl` | Binary and ASCII mesh |
| `.ply` | Binary and ASCII mesh with vertex colors |
| `.obj` | Mesh and vertex colors |
| `.glb` | Meshes with embedded textures supported by the viewer |
| `.hps` | native HPS mesh support in release packages |
| `.dcm` | legacy alias for HPS containers |

In OccluView, `.dcm` means the proprietary 3Shape dental container. It is not
medical DICOM. Encrypted HPS files read the key from
`OCCLUVIEW_HPS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (legacy environment aliases are also accepted);
the key is never taken from command arguments or written to output.

## Windows

The MSI installer registers supported mesh formats and installs the Explorer
thumbnail and Preview Pane handlers. Opening another file while OccluView is
already running adds it to the current scene instead of opening another window.
File types use neutral names and one shared 3D-object icon.

## Linux

The Debian package installs the application, desktop entry, MIME registration,
icon, and thumbnailer.

## Performance

Measured end to end on a Ryzen 5 3600 with a warm file cache:

| File | Size | Open time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intraoral scan, 300k triangles | 15 MB binary STL | about 0.1 s |
| 1M triangles | 50 MB binary STL | about 0.4 s |
| 5M triangles | 250 MB binary STL | about 1.8 s |

Results depend on storage, CPU, mesh topology, and texture data.

## Download

The latest release is [v1.0.2](https://github.com/occlutrace/OccluView/releases/tag/v1.0.2).

- **Windows MSI**: normal installation with Explorer integration.
- **Windows portable ZIP**: runs without installation or Explorer integration.
- **Debian package**: for Debian, Ubuntu, and compatible desktops.

```bash
sudo apt install ./occluview_<version>_amd64.deb
```

Release files include SHA-256 checksums.

## Build from source

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo run -p occluview-app --release -- path/to/scan.stl
```

Generate a thumbnail with the CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p occluview-cli --release -- thumbnail scan.stl -o thumb.png --size 256
```

For HPS conversion, the CLI writes `surface.ply`, an optional textured
`surface.glb`, and `manifest.json` to the selected output directory:

```bash
cargo run -p occluview-cli --bin occluview-hps-export --release -- \
  --input scan.hps \
  --output-dir ./converted
```

The converter always uses these fixed output names. `manifest.json` is schema
version 2: it contains the parser version, a required geometry artifact, and an
optional textured preview artifact. The same JSON object is printed on stdout;
each artifact records its relative format, path, and lowercase SHA-256.
