# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-14

- Declared the first stable release after the viewer, editor, HPS path,
  Windows Explorer integration, Linux packaging, and update channel reached a
  single release-tested baseline.
- Moved thumbnail loading, rendering, caching, and placeholder handling into a
  platform-neutral crate shared by the Windows shell adapter, Linux
  thumbnailer, and headless CLI.
- Kept the HPS parser as the single format leaf and shipped conversion as a
  second machine-facing binary in `occluview-cli` instead of coupling it to
  the desktop viewer.
- Added minisign coverage for the portable Windows archive alongside the MSI
  and Debian update artifacts.

## 0.1.39 - 2026-07-13

- Deduplicated copied mesh files in Explorer thumbnail bursts using a bounded
  content cache and single-flight render path.
- Separated twelve bounded decode lanes from one reusable GPU renderer, avoiding
  Windows driver contention while keeping mixed folders responsive.
- Fixed the release workflow's tracked-source key scan for current Git runners.

## 0.1.38 - 2026-07-13

- Matched the bounded thumbnail renderer to Explorer's twelve-request fan-out,
  preventing mixed folders from queueing long enough for Windows to cache
  generic format icons while still retaining a hard worker lifetime budget.

## 0.1.37 - 2026-07-13

- Restored fast mixed-folder Explorer thumbnail generation with a bounded
  four-to-twelve worker budget, so large folders no longer serialize behind
  two long-running renders while timed-out workers remain accounted for.

## 0.1.36 - 2026-07-13

- Hardened Bridge Split for dental meshes made from overlapping, touching, or
  separately indexed shells without discarding valid small geometry.
- Kept finite separator behavior strict: only the placed disc can affect a
  component, while impossible placements fail atomically without changing the
  source scene.
- Added coverage for cavities, reflected shells, microscopic components,
  remote arch geometry, and importer-degenerate faces.
- Kept mixed-folder Explorer thumbnail work bounded and the Windows viewer
  camera responsive in the release build.

## 0.1.35 - 2026-07-12

- Restored `Close holes` to Mesh Editor. With no face marks it repairs safe
  interior holes across every visible mesh layer in one atomic, undoable scene
  operation; hidden layers remain untouched. Marked faces still scope the
  repair, and the optional rim-perimeter limit is available again.
- Bridge Split now gives the finite separator disc priority for plain meshes,
  so a disc placed on a curved arch cannot silently behave like an infinite
  plane and cut a remote arm outside its footprint.
- Kept the native CSG boundary isolated behind a safe Rust crate and made its
  ownership/layering explicit in the workspace contracts.

## 0.1.34 - 2026-07-12

- Bridge Split now evaluates the separator's finite footprint, avoiding false
  diameter errors caused by distant parts of a curved dental arch.
- Cut View and Bridge Split share steadier separator placement, direct disc
  manipulation, editable Section measurements, and consistent close controls.
- Edit Mesh now selects and edits across all visible mesh layers in one atomic
  operation; hidden layers retain their geometry and selection state.

## 0.1.33 - 2026-07-12

- Bridge Split now retries the robust CSG path when the direct capper creates
  an invalid part, and stabilizes output only when conversion to viewer mesh
  precision would otherwise invalidate a closed result.

## 0.1.32 - 2026-07-11

- Bridge Split now falls back to a robust finite-disc CSG operation for closed
  plain meshes when the direct cutter cannot form clean caps around pathological
  but topology-bearing CAD facets. The result remains two closed parts with the
  requested kerf; normal scan paths stay on the fast cutter.

## 0.1.31 - 2026-07-11

- Bridge Split now normalizes common importer residue in an isolated working
  copy before cutting: redundant zero-area or duplicate faces, small holes,
  inconsistent winding, and removable debris no longer require a manual
  repair step when the result can be made into two closed parts.
- Healthy meshes retain the direct split path; source geometry and its
  materials remain untouched until the completed split is applied.

## 0.1.30 - 2026-07-11

- Reworked Bridge Split around the separator disc actually placed by the
  operator. A split now proceeds only when that disc spans the full kerf
  cross-section and can produce two closed parts with the requested gap.
- Added a live Section view during Bridge Split, with the same Lines/Mesh,
  measurement, pan, zoom, and disc-size controls used by Cut View.
- Replaced the generic split failure with specific guidance for missed,
  tangent, undersized, open, and invalid mesh cases.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-07-08

- Added public README media for the main viewer and the Windows Explorer live
  Preview Pane, so the repository shows the actual product instead of only
  install notes.
- Updated the README around the current Windows experience: MSI-installed file
  associations, Explorer thumbnails, one neutral 3D file icon, and interactive
  Preview Pane support for supported mesh formats.
- Continued the architecture cleanup by splitting large shell registration,
  glTF reader, core mesh, and preview-handler modules into focused internal
  files while preserving the public Rust APIs and Windows shell ABI.
- Hardened Linux single-instance file opens so a background viewer keeps waking
  until a file-manager handoff is consumed, then repeats the foreground pulse
  after the appended scene is ready.
- Kept the release path on the tag-driven Windows MSI / portable ZIP / Debian
  package workflow.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-07-08

- Continued the app architecture cleanup by moving startup bootstrap, scene
  loading, and dialog/chrome helper logic out of the main viewer file.
- Hardened single-instance open handoff with a bounded framed request format,
  legacy fallback parsing, and stricter path validation.
- Hardened Explorer thumbnail stream reuse by rewinding pending streams before
  lazy reads, adding offset-stream smoke coverage, and covering stream-cache
  eviction.
- Reduced duplicate Explorer thumbnail work during burst folders by coalescing
  concurrent identical requests after cache misses, while keeping bounded
  worker fan-out ahead of the renderer pool.
- Stopped timed-out followers in that in-flight thumbnail path from launching a
  second render under burst pressure; they now return the deterministic
  fallback instead of amplifying load in large mixed folders.
- Expanded the mixed-folder thumbnail smoke to cover larger burst folders and
  verify that non-3D neighbors do not turn into shell-path failures while real
  3D files still render actual thumbnails.
- Continued reducing brittle source-layout-sensitive tests by moving app/shell
  coverage toward the smaller modules that now own viewport, loading, and
  render behavior.
- Moved the main viewer render lifecycle and scene-state helpers out of
  `main.rs`, further shrinking the entrypoint into a thinner wiring layer.
- Quieted Linux shell-render test noise by setting an explicit runtime
  directory for GPU-backed shell tests.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-07-08

- Removed the visible layer overflow button and moved layer actions to the row
  right-click menu, while keeping the remove button inline.
- Corrected Explorer Preview Pane orbit input so drag direction matches the
  expected Windows preview feel without changing the main viewer camera.
- Hardened Explorer thumbnail bursts in mixed folders by deferring stream reads
  until `GetThumbnail`, rejecting unsupported noise before worker startup, and
  allowing a slightly wider bounded renderer pool.
- Kept OBJ thumbnail and preview fallback coverage for noisy small scanner
  files that the strict full parser may reject.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-07-08

- Hardened the Debian release path with an extracted-package smoke check that
  verifies required binaries, desktop integration files, MIME metadata,
  thumbnailer registration, maintainer scripts, XML/AppStream validity,
  shared-library resolution, and `lintian` errors in CI.
- Kept Windows and Linux release assets on one tag-driven workflow, with tag
  version checks before package publishing.
- Continued the app architecture cleanup by moving viewer helper, state-path,
  layer-overlay, file-helper, scene-load, and chrome-helper logic out of the
  main viewer file.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-07-08

- Added native Linux desktop support by building the real `occluview` egui/wgpu
  app on Linux, with XDG state/runtime paths, Unix socket open handoff, and
  stale-lock recovery after crashes.
- Added Debian packaging with freedesktop launcher, MIME registration,
  thumbnailer, AppStream metadata, app icon, maintainer hooks, and runtime
  dependencies for X11/Wayland/Vulkan desktops.
- Extended the release workflow so version tags build Windows MSI/portable ZIP
  and Linux `.deb` assets, then publish all artifacts and checksums to one
  GitHub Release.
- Included encrypted HPS support in shipped Windows and Linux packages.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-07-07

- Hardened the Windows thumbnail smoke so the MSI workflow now compares the
  direct `IThumbnailProvider` path against Explorer's `IShellItemImageFactory`
  path instead of accepting any non-null bitmap.
- Added real `stl`, `ply`, and HPS smoke fixtures, including the legacy package
  alias, so Explorer thumbnail validation covers the formats the app ships.
- Switched the cached Explorer thumbnail renderer to prefer a hardware adapter
  before falling back, reducing cold-start latency when the shell bursts
  through many thumbnails.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-07-07

- Fixed the Windows packaging path after the failed `0.1.5` packaging attempt:
  `occluview-shell` now requests the correct `windows-rs` input focus modules
  and passes a local `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` shell check before tagging.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-07

- Added an Explorer Preview Pane handler for supported mesh and dental scan
  formats.
- Hardened the Windows shell integration smoke path with installed thumbnail
  and preview lifecycle validation, including MSI upgrade and uninstall checks.
- Tightened preview-handler COM lifecycle behavior around focus, reparenting,
  teardown, and unloadability.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-06

- Stabilized multi-file opens so new scans join the existing scene without
  re-homing the camera.
- Constrained in-viewport layer names so long filenames do not resize the
  overlay.
- Improved live viewport anti-aliasing and studio lighting readability.
- Switched shell thumbnails to orthographic framing and added file-path
  initialization for more reliable Explorer extension detection.
- Prepared the first public Windows package path.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-07-06

- Native Windows viewer with a full-window 3D viewport.
- Open paths for STL, PLY, OBJ, GLB, and HPS, including the legacy package
  alias.
- Explorer thumbnail provider and MSI packaging path.
- Neutral Windows file type names and one generic 3D file icon.
- HPS release build path with basic binary hardening.
