## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **PLY reader** (`occluview-formats::ply`): ASCII + binary little-endian +
  big-endian, with full vertex-color support (the dental NIRI/mucosal-shade
  format). Header parser, ASCII token reader, binary Cursor with Endian
  helpers. 22 new tests.
- **STL reader** (`occluview-formats::stl`): binary + ASCII, with dental-scanner
  quirk tolerance (lying triangle counts, non-ASCII headers, missing
  `endsolid`, case-insensitive keywords).
- **Research base** consolidated into the ADRs
  investigation (Windows shell, render stack, governance, formats, landscape)
  that validated and refined the foundational decisions.
- Project foundation: `AGENTS.md` (constitution + 7-stage workflow),
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `TRADEMARK.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- Architecture documentation: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the foundational ADR set
  (ADR-0001 … ADR-0009), recording decisions on language (Rust), GPU layer
  (wgpu), GUI (egui), loaders (per-format), shell integration (out-of-process
  COM), build (Cargo), mesh-only scope, Apache-2.0 licensing, and dental defaults.
- Engineering docs: `docs/ENGINEERING.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`,
  `docs/SHELL_INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md`,
  `docs/FORMAT_SUPPORT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Workspace skeleton: `crates/{core,formats,render,shell,app,cli}` with crate
  manifests and stub `lib.rs`/`main.rs` files (no functional behavior yet).
- Tooling: pinned `rust-toolchain.toml`, workspace `Cargo.toml`, `deny.toml`,
  `clippy.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`.
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow enforcing fmt / clippy / test / deny / docs / perf.
- Community: issue templates, PR template with the Definition-of-Done checklist,
  `CODEOWNERS`.

### Notes
- Implementation begins after this foundational commit. No binary is released
  yet; the first shipped binary will be `v0.1.0`.
