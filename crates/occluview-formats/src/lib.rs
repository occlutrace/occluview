//! `occluview-formats` — 3D file format readers (and eventually writers).
//!
//! Each format has its own module implementing the [`FormatReader`] trait, so a
//! new format is added by writing a module + registering it in [`dispatch`] — no
//! changes to `core`, `render`, or `app`.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Parsers return [`FormatError`] on malformed input; they never panic.
//! - Path traversal is forbidden before any external resource format is exposed
//!   to the app or shell (`.gltf` JSON and 3MF are deferred from v1 surfaces).
//! - Coordinate-frame conversion to OccluView's Y-up RH frame happens here, not
//!   in the renderer (see [`occluview_core::frame`]).
//! - Units: STL/OBJ declare none (assume mm, surfaced in UI); GLB declares
//!   meters but scanner exports vary, so v1 keeps coordinates unchanged.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! v1 open surfaces intentionally expose only implemented, product-approved
//! readers: STL, PLY, OBJ, GLB, and HPS.

// `deny(unsafe_code)` (not `forbid`): the mmap streaming path
// (dispatch::read_file) needs one `unsafe` block for memmap2::Mmap::map,
// which is the audited kernel-FFI for memory-mapping. All format PARSERS
// remain safe; the lone unsafe lives behind the read_file helper.
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
// Test-only relaxation of strict lints; production parser code stays stricter.
